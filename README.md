# EcoGrow 🌱  
_A tree-planting reward platform built with tpescrip, react abd superbase

## 🚀 Overview  
EcoGrow is a web-platform that encourages users to plant, nurture and monitor trees — while earning tokens that can be redeemed for real-world items like fertilizer and supplies.  
Designed for environmental impact and community engagement, EcoGrow connects sustainable action with tangible rewards.

## 🎯 Key Features  
- **User registration & authentication**: Users can sign up, log in and create their profile.  
- **Plant a tree**: Users select a tree, enter planting details (location, date), and start a growth timer.  
- **Growth monitoring**: Track your tree’s progress over time, uploading photos or updates.  
- **Earn tokens**: As the tree matures, the user earns tokens into their account.  
- **Token redemption**: Use tokens in the marketplace to buy items (e.g., fertilizer, saplings).  
- **Admin dashboard**: Manage users, verify growth requests, and monitor statistics (revenue, daily transactions).  
- **Mobile & responsive friendly**: Designed to work across phones and desktop.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Backend / Database**: <e.g., Firebase Auth + Firestore>
